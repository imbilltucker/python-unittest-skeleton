Python Unittest Skeleton
========================

This is a skeleton Python unittest file to allow it to be grabbed and
filled in, instead of having to remember the structure.

The "test_skeleton.py" is an example of standard Python tests.

The "test_bottle.py" is some test code for a Bottle web application.

Usage
-----

To use:

  * Check out repository.

  * Copy "test/test_skeleton.py" into your "test" directory.

  * Rename "test_skeleton.py" to something more descriptive.  (Note: It
    should keep the "test_" prefix, so that "make" will
    run the tests).

  * Edit this file and search for "XXX".

  * Copy "Makefile" into your test directory.  It should work without
    modification.

  * If you are doing bottle web development, copy "test_bottle.py" into
    your "test" directory and rename it to something more useful.
